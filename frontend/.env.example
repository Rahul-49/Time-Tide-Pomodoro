# Copy to .env (in this same frontend folder) and adjust values as needed.

# Optional: set the base public path when serving or building.
# Leave unset for root deployments (recommended for local dev):
# VITE_BASE_PATH=/
# Set to a subpath only if you deploy the app under that subpath, e.g. GitHub Pages or a reverse proxy location:
# VITE_BASE_PATH=/TIme-Tide-Smart-Time-Management
